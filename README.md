# FbW39 Tutoring repository

Here I will be uploading different sessions and/or projects that we will create in the sessions for future reference. There will be projects coming to practice and learn new skills, taking the **learn by doing** approach.


# Planned projects

Some of the planned projects will be a ***Rock paper scissors*** game, which will also include the UI to practice the DOM. There will also be other games such as ***Tic Tac Toe*** to have fun while learning. 
You are also welcome to give ideas for future projects!
